Collaborators:
- We asked ChatGPT about GUI to understand how the new tool, how they work and how to use them. We also aksed for some help in organizing our code since we had a lot of components to work with such as the terminal, GUI, csv files, separate ml files. So it was a bit confusing how to combine and organize sometimes.
- We also referenced a3 assignment to review BatSet and use similar functionality for our project. We used one of the txt files given to us for a3 (SINGLE.txt) as dictionary ("accepted_words.csv") file here.
